/*
==> This question is asked in MNCs like google,microsoft etc.
==> When given nos. from a rage of 1 to N => always use cycle sort because the complexity.

// Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the cycle sort algorithm:

=> Start with an unsorted array of n elements.
=> Initialize a variable, cycleStart, to 0.
=>For each element in the array, compare it with every other element to its right. If there are any elements that are smaller than the current element, increment cycleStart.
=>If cycleStart is still 0 after comparing the first element with all other elements, move to the next element and repeat step 3.
=>Once a smaller element is found, swap the current element with the first element in its cycle. The cycle is then continued until the current element returns to its original position.
=>Repeat steps 3-5 until all cycles have been completed.
/*
In this the index of value is the value -1 .
