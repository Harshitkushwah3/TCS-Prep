In Bubble Sort algorithm,

=> traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side.
=> In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first.
=> This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

:==> Bubble sort is also known as sinking or exchanging sort
